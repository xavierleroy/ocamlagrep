DESCRIPTION
-----------

This library implements the Wu-Manber algorithm for string searching
with errors, popularized by the "agrep" Unix command and the "glimpse"
file indexing tool.

Given a search pattern and a string, this algorithm determines whether
the string contains a substring that matches the pattern up to a
parameterizable number N of "errors".  An "error" is either a
substitution (replace a character of the string with another
character), a deletion (remove a character) or an insertion (add a
character to the string).

The search patterns are roughly those of the Unix shell, including
one-character wildcard (?), character classes ([0-9]) and multi-character
wildcard (*).  In addition, conjunction (&) and alternative (|) are
supported.  General regular expressions are not supported, however.

Performance is quite good: for short patterns (less than 31 characters)
and no errors, this library is about 8 times faster than OCaml's "Str"
regular expression library.  Speed decreases with the number of errors
allowed, but even with 3 errors we are still faster than "Str".

The algorithm is described in S. Wu and U. Manber, ``Fast Text
Searching Allowing Errors," Communications of the ACM 35 (October
1992), pp. 83-91.  It's a nice exercise in dynamic programming and
bit-parallel implementation.


INSTALLATION
------------

OCaml 3.04 and up is required.

Do "make".
Become superuser, and do "make install" or "make DESTDIR=... install"
to specify the installation directory (by default: the subdirectory "agrep"
of OCaml's standard library directory).


USAGE
-----

        ocamlc -I +agrep ... agrep.cma ...
or
        ocamlopt -I +agrep ... agrep.cmxa ...
